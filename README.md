SreeMusicPlayer
===============

This is my first program written entirely in python v3. This is still in earlier stages. Lot of fun work/code to do ;)


HOW-TO:

You will have to install Python 3 and pygame module first. Without player them this won't work

Open terminal and change folder to the SreeMUsic Player folder and then run the below code

python3 music.py

python3 music.py song1 song2


Commands:
=========

add -> adds songs to end of playlist ===> Syntax: add song1 "song 2" "song three" song4

list -> shows songs in current playlist

play -> play/resume song

pause -> pause song

current -> show current playing song name(with full path)

clear -> clear the playlist and make it empty

stop -> stop song and reset current song to zero


Bugs:
=====

Errors are not handling in this version. So report me any bugs or errors the player shows.

Bugs Fixed:
===========

Bug related to adding extra spaces fixed. Now you can add extra spaces before or after the command and they will be automatically removed.

Author's words:
===============

At present it runs only in command line. But i am planing to make a GUI for it in future.

This is my first music player and in fact my first project. I wrote this completely in python 3.

It worked well in my system which is Intel i3 powered. Running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit.

This is still in earlier stage of development, like in pre-pre-alpha, yup ;)

I don't know how far this project goes as i am not sure. But don't worry i am working my best to move it forward.

After the backend i will be starting the GUI for the player.

Feel free to give me any suggestions. Thank you for your time.
